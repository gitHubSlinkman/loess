Local regression or local polynomial regression, also known as moving regression, is a generalization of moving average and polynomial regression. Its most common methods, initially developed for scatterplot smoothing, are LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) and LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing), both pronounced /ˈloʊɛs/. They are two strongly related non-parametric regression methods that combine multiple regression models in a k-nearest-neighbor-based meta-model. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression)

Local regression technique are useful for detecting non-linearity between the predictor and response variables.

It is also useful for interpolating the values of the predictor variable peovided the predictor variables are within the bounds of the predictor variables used to fit the data set, that is, when you are not extrapolating,
